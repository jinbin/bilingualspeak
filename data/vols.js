      'I have heard and read a lot about the beautiful countries in the world. However, the country I would like to visit is Great Britain. My choice is based on the following reasons. ',
      'Firstly, I have been interested in this country since school years as English was one of the subjects studied at school. The pictures of the old buildings in text-books have inspired me and visiting this country has become somewhat a dream for me. Most of all I’d like to visit London and its sights.',
      'Moreover, London has a good public transportation system, underground and double-deck bus. I could go any places via the convenient underground and do sightseeing by bus. ',
      'Another reason for my preference is that I would like to have deeper knowledge about the history and the culture of England and the English people because I really like this country. Besides, I would certainly visit the old Universities of Cambridge and Oxford. ',
      'In conclusion, I should therefore welcome any opportunity to visit this country.'

      'I like this topic, it’s about vacation and everyone likes vacation. When I was young, on my vacation I was always trying to go to as many places as possible because I want to see all the beautiful sceneries, all the wonderful places and I don't wanna miss a single place. However, when I grow older, I change my mind that I believe that staying in the same place for the whole vacation will lead to a better experience.',
      'First, we must remember the purpose of vacation. It’s not about showing off for how many places we have been to, it’s about having a good rest, relaxing yourself and regaining energy. Staying in the same place saves us a lot of time on traffic and we won’t feel pushed to go to different places.',
      'Secondly, staying in the same place gives us enough time to feel every wonderful detail in travel. You can see the sun rise and sun set of the same city. You can find out the best restaurant and have a wonderful delicious meal there. You have enough time to talk with local residents about their daily life. If you choose to spend short time at different places, probably you have only time to take picture. You can’t have a deep understanding of local lifestyle.',
      'Moreover, those places we haven’t been to is not a pity, but a motivation that can attract us to back again. In a word, staying in the same place for the whole vacation will be a better choice.'

      'I’ve wanted to travel there ever since my lecturer at college introduced me to this country which happens to be one of the most hostile regions in the world. It is quite possible to travel there though as tourism is allowed. It is strictly controlled, but allowed. I have read many articles/Quora answers written by people who have had the privilege of travelling there and the collective feeling is that travelling there makes one feel like going back in time.',
      'That is why I want to travel to North Korea. I want to experience going back in time.',
      'The people over there do not even have mobile phones, can not own cars, have to rely on hard, manual labour to feed themselves. There are Government approved haircuts, government approved radio stations, education, and what not. Almost anything that we do on a daily basis is banned over there or is controlled by the Government. The tourists are made to stay at a hotel which is in the middle of an island and there is no way one can travel on his/her own. One would always be accompanied by a guide who would take us around the place. Oh, I have read that we would have to deposit our phones / electronic devices at the Airport. Cameras are allowed, but photos can be taken only with the permission/approval of our guides. Any photo that showcases the poverty of the country has to be deleted.',

      "I would go to New Zealand for a trip if I had a chance. It's a lovely country, made up two islands. It is very lush and green because it rains a lot there. I would do a lot of different things and one thing I would definitely do is to swim with the dolphins. One of my friends ever did it, which she said was very interesting. At first, she was only brave enough to pat them and then she got braver and held on to one's fin while it took her for a swim. They moved very quickly and gracefully through the water and it was fascinating. So the place for a trip would be New Zealand! I’d like to go to Japan if I have a chance.Visiting the Fuji mountain is one of my dreams, you know the peak covered with snow stands there erectly stretching up to the sky ,it is just fascinating. The beautiful scenery of the countryside and the modern amenities in the cities are both attractive to me.What’s more, I am very interested in Japanese history and culture. If I could go there I could deepen my understanding of them.In addition, Japanese girls are very soft and tender which sounds fascinating to me. I am really eager to make friends with them and maybe I could find a charming girl friend."

      'I am lucky, although I live in a city, from my house I can walk to the edges of the Peak District, which is a beautiful national park just a few miles from the city centre. To get to the national park I have to walk from my house down some local roads, and up a steep hill past some allotments. After about a mile or so striding out away from the urban areas, I get to a lovely bit of woodland which has a public footpath you can follow onwards and upwards. It can be a bit of a scramble towards the end of the path as it is very steep indeed, but eventually, you leave the woodland and are on the edge of open farmland. Another footpath crosses some sheep-filled fields, and finally, you are on the moors of the Peak District. It is really spectacular.',
      'The Peak District can be a really wild place, with its vast expanses of open moorland. You are high up, and it is quite exposed so it can be very windy and cold even in the summer. There are rocky outcrops and strange configurations of stones that have been weathered by centuries of wind and rain to create dramatic shapes. Some boulders are in piles, and there are steep vertical cliffs too. The area attracts lots of people who like walking, climbing and bouldering because of its unique and beautiful landscape. Everywhere is dark wet peat underfoot and lots of heathers. This is a low growing plant that flowers at the end of the summer turning the whole landscape purple. The park covers a huge area, I think around 555 square miles, so the terrain differs from area to area, of course, I am biased, but I believe I live near the most remarkably beautiful part.',
      "I love this place, because if ever I am feeling down, or a bit enclosed, in just an hours walk I can find myself in a deserted but picturesque place, where the elements are more extreme. In winter rain and wind can batter you, but in summer the sky seems to go on forever. Every day is different up there, and every hour of every day too. The area is so huge, that often you can have it all to yourself, of course, there are other walkers about, but you can quickly disappear in the vastness of the space. The people who live in Sheffield, like me, are very proud that we are so near to the Peak District National Park, and it is no surprise it became the United Kingdom's first national park on 17 April 1951. A birthday that should be celebrated I think!"

We were very excited thatwe splashed water to each other. And suddenly, a big fish jumped out of the water and we became more excited and we began to strike the water surface with the paddles.
